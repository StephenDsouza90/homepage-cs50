# The Simpsons

I am a fan of the sitcom series **The Simpsons** therefore I found it interesting to create a website about it. There are three html files of the Simpsons and one html file of myself (a short introduction about me).

## Assets

The CSS and SCSS files are saved in the css folder and Images used in the web applications are in the images folder.

## HTML Files

1. Index: A short introduction about the Simpsons.
2. Characters: The main characters along with their images.
3. Seasons: A table contianing the seaons along with its respective number of episodes.
4. About me: A short introduction about me.
